description: Variables for sensorless homing X and Y

variable_homing_current_x: 0.9                # The desired motor current for homing the X and Y axes. Leave as '0.0' to use run_current values instead.
variable_homing_current_y: 0.9                # The desired motor current for homing the X and Y axes. Leave as '0.0' to use run_current values instead.
variable_clear_time: 3                      # Time in seconds to wait for stallguard registers to clear, default is 1 second.
variable_x_backoff_distance: 30             # Distance in mm to back off from the X axis after homing.
variable_y_backoff_distance: 30             # Distance in mm to back off from the Y axis after homing.
variable_z_backoff_distance: 10
variable_z_hop_distance: 6                  # Distance to move Z axis prior to homing, and after homing.
variable_first_homed_axis: 'Y'              # First axis to home when 'G28' is called. Some prefer homing Y before X. #Added option for Z first
variable_z_after_home: 20                   # Position to set Z after homing.
variable_z_after_bed: 10                    # Position to set Z after probing bed with nozzle 
variable_probe_after_z: False                 #Probe bed with mesh sensor after homing Z. True or false
variable_z_after_tilt: 20

variable_safe_z_enable: True               # Enables/disables moving the printhead before homing the Z axis.
variable_safe_x: 150                    # Safe X position to home the Z axis, leave at -128 to home to the center of the X axis.
variable_safe_y: 150                   # Safe Y position to home the Z axis, leave at -128 to home to the center of the Y axis.
